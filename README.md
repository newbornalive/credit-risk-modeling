PROJECT NAME: Credit Risk Modeling

DATASET SOURCE: Kaggle - Give Me Some Credit

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting loan default risk using the 'Give Me Some Credit' dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to assess an applicant's likelihood of defaulting based on financial indicators and historical data.

DATASET DETAILS:
- Source: Kaggle - Give Me Some Credit
- Features: Various financial metrics including income, debt ratio, credit history, and loan details.
- Target Variable: SeriousDlqin2yrs (1 = Default, 0 = No Default)

PREPROCESSING STEPS:
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Data splitting into training and test sets

MODELING APPROACH:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Neural Networks (optional)

MODEL EVALUATION METRICS:
- AUC-ROC Curve for classification performance
- Precision, Recall, F1-score to measure accuracy
- Confusion Matrix for error analysis
- SHAP Values for feature importance and model interpretability

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Implement deep learning models for comparison
- Use real-time financial data for continuous learning
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for a web-based interface

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements!
